      <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h3>
<p>
<ol>
        <li>That my self-awareness isn't where I want it to be, but is being worked on.</li>
        <li>That being a student is harder than I remember - my self discipline is a work in progress.</li>
        <li>That I apply myself more when I enjoy what I'm doing.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
<p>I think this will become a lot clearer during bootcamp (especially while pair programming) but so far I would say:
<ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Values</span> shape how we collaborate and interact with each other - we've done a bit of this during weekly meetings but will be interacting a lot more during bootcamp and can expect to when working as a developer too.<li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Empathy</span> and understanding that everyone has things going on and learns/works at their own pace is important. The empathy from facilitators has been really positive and well timed too - a lot of the learning material says things like 'don't worry if it doesn't make sense yet' which I've found really reassuring.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Self Awareness</span> is huge when it comes to programming - recognising when you're feeling frustrated/overwhelmed and taking a moment is so important.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
<p>Probably how long it can take and that it actually helps the tech content stick. I would usually (mostly) stop thinking about something after doing it, but have found that by revisiting/remembering it during reflections and blog posts it often makes a bit more sense.</p>

<h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h3>
<p>Probably just the fact that it was unexpected. A big part of why I didn't enjoy my last role was how interactive and collaborative it was (more in a public speaking/presenting sense) but so far the course hasn't been too out of my comfort zone.</p>

<h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
<p>I noticed during my last role just how involved the developers are with the wider project team - I'm guessing the intention here is that we are hireable and job ready.</p> 

<h3>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
<p>Yes and no. Yes because I feel I need all the programming time I can get and no because I understand that human skills are just as important.</p>
