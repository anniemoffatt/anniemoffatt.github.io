      <h2>Analogy</h2>
      <p>
        In one of my reflections I think I compared HTML to dog breeds. If HTML
        is the Border Collie (structure and smarts) and CSS is the Golden
        Retriever (style and friendliness) then JavaScript could either be the
        German Shepherd (alert, acts on command) or the owner maybe (calling the
        shots, telling the others what to do and when).
      </p>

      <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
      <p>If we use a round of golf as an example,</p>
      <p>The Control Flow would be the steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Tee off from the first hole</li>
        <li>Hit the ball towards the green until you reach it</li>
        <li>Putt the ball until it goes in the hole</li>
        <li>Move to the next hole</li>
      </ol>

      <p>You might also have conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the ball lands in the bunker, use a sand wedge</li>
        <li>If you're on the green, use a putter</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Loops happen when something repeats until a condition is met, like
        repeatedly hitting the ball until it gets in the hole.
      </p>
      <p>(Need to add code examples)</p>

      <h2>The DOM</h2>
      <p>
        The DOM (Document Object Model) is how JavaScript sees and interacts
        with a webpage.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns HTML elements into objects that JavaScript can then access and
        change.
      </p>
      <p>
        This week we did the JavaScript Cafe Challenge. It involved 'building' a
        web app then using the DOM to update elements based on customer
        interaction. We used JavaScript to randomly generate orders, display the
        orders and update stock counts accordingly (in real time, without having
        to refresh the page).
      </p>

      <h2>Arrays vs Objects</h2>
      <p>
        Arrays and objects are both ways of storing data in JavaScript, but are
        used differently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrays are ordered lists, whereas objects are more like containers.
        During the JavaScript Cafe Challenge we used arrays to store lists of
        things - like customer orders, and objects to store information about
        each product - like stock and price.
      </p>

      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Functions are reusable blocks of code that do a specific thing. You
        write the steps once then can run the function repeatedly without having
        to rewrite it each time.
