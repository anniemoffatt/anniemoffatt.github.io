      <h2>Long Term Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Eventually I would love to work as a fullstack developer - with a
        particular interest in front end development and AI.
      </p>

      <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        I'm creative and pay good attention to detail but my confidence needs
        work.
      </p>

      <h2>Skills I'd Like to Develop</h2>
      <p>
        Would love to build my knowledge base, confidence and become more
        assertive. Even small improvements in how I communicate and advocate for
        myself would be huge.
      </p>

      <h2>Managing My Workload</h2>
      <p>
        To stay productive and work well with others I intend to communicate
        clearly and make the most of any available assistance - I'm still
        building my knowledge base, so insight on anything from anyone would be
        valuable.
      </p>

      <p>
        When things feel frustrating or overwhelming I'll take a walk, go for a
        drive or play some golf. It's only the second week and I'm already
        realising how important taking a moment is.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've also noticed that most of my challenges pop up after home group or
        during weekends when support is limited. I'm working on using home group
        meetings to reflect on the previous week and bring questions forward. I
        would also like to get better at recognising when to stop trying to
        figure something out on my own and ask for help.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Expect from the Facilitation Team</h2>
      <p>Availability, clear communication and constructive feedback.</p>

      <h2>Scheduling and Commitments</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing currently, I'll be sure to let the team know if anything comes
        up.
