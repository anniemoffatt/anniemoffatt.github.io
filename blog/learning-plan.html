      <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>

      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        Still to be a fullstack developer - am probably preferring/stronger at
        front end at this stage. Mainly I just hope to be successful in a role I
        enjoy.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Both (from my Foundations Learning Plan) are still very much relevant. I
        think being creative and paying good attention to detail will definitely
        be useful during bootcamp, but on the other hand I hope me not feeling
        hugely confident in the work doesn't affect group tasks too much. All I
        would add is that I'm really keen to learn more and do well so I'd say
        my attitude is a strength. I'm also quite self critical though so I hope
        I don't let stress or overwhelm convince me I'm not capable or am in the
        wrong place.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Group work or anything I have to present - I would always dread this at
        university and during my last role. In a space where I already don't
        know what I'm doing I feel there's an added pressure to interact - I
        tend to prefer figuring things out on my own and in my own time.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        If my attitude towards group work or presenting improves even slightly I
        would be so stoked. The idea of it literally keeps me up at night so to
        get over that would be life changing.
      </p>

      <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p>
        Honestly just the same as during Foundations - availability, clear
        communication and constructive feedback.
      </p>

      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>
        That I lock in - but give myself grace at the same time. To communicate
        if I'm feeling overwhelmed but also to remember that I probably won't be
        the only one.
      </p>

      <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>

      <h3>Long Term Goal</h3>
      <p>
        Eventually I would love to work as a fullstack developer (am especially
        interested in front end development and AI too).
      </p>

      <h3>Strengths and Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        I'm creative and pay good attention to detail but my confidence could be
        better.
      </p>

      <h3>Skills I'd Like to Develop</h3>
      <p>
        Would love to build my knowledge base, confidence and become more
        assertive. Even small improvements in how I communicate and advocate for
        myself would be huge.
      </p>

      <h3>Managing My Workload</h3>
      <p>
        I intend to communicate clearly and make the most of any available
        assistance - most of the course content has been foreign to me so far so
        any insight is valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
        When things feel frustrating or overwhelming I'll take a break - either
        a walk or drive. It's only the second week and I'm already realising how
        important taking a moment is.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also noticed that most of my challenges pop up after home group or
        during weekends when support is limited. I'm working on using home group
        meetings to reflect on the previous week and bring questions forward. I
        would also like to get better at recognising when to stop trying to
        figure something out on my own and ask for help.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Expect from the Facilitation Team</h3>
      <p>Availability, clear communication and constructive feedback.</p>

      <h3>Scheduling and Commitments</h3>
      <p>
        Nothing currently, I'll be sure to let the team know if anything comes
        up.
