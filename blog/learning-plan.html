      <h2>Long Term Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Eventually I would love to work as a fullstack developer (am especially
        interested in front end development and AI too).
      </p>

      <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        I'm creative and pay good attention to detail but my confidence could be
        better.
      </p>

      <h2>Skills I'd Like to Develop</h2>
      <p>
        Would love to build my knowledge base, confidence and become more
        assertive. Even small improvements in how I communicate and advocate for
        myself would be huge.
      </p>

      <h2>Managing My Workload</h2>
      <p>
        I intend to communicate clearly and make the most of any available
        assistance - most of the course content has been foreign to me so far so
        any insight is valuable.
      </p>

      <p>
        When things feel frustrating or overwhelming I'll take a break - either
        a walk or drive. It's only the second week and I'm already realising how
        important taking a moment is.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've also noticed that most of my challenges pop up after home group or
        during weekends when support is limited. I'm working on using home group
        meetings to reflect on the previous week and bring questions forward. I
        would also like to get better at recognising when to stop trying to
        figure something out on my own and ask for help.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Expect from the Facilitation Team</h2>
      <p>Availability, clear communication and constructive feedback.</p>

      <h2>Scheduling and Commitments</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing currently, I'll be sure to let the team know if anything comes
        up.
