      <h2>Ethical Decision Making</h2>
      <p>
        I was raised to prioritise stability, so after being made redundant the
        expected move was to look for another BA role. I realised that didn’t
        make me happy so instead made the (pretty risky) decision to go back to
        study, upskill and pursue something I actually enjoy. It wasn’t the
        safest option, but it felt like the right thing to do long term.
      </p>

      <h2>Cultural and Social Influences</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up with a lot of structure, which is probably why I think
        logically, am process driven and curious about how things work. Kindness
        and respect are also huge for me, shaped mostly by family and friends. I
        try to bring both into whatever I do.
      </p>

      <h2>Strengths in My Learning Journey</h2>
      <p>
        I've been enjoying development work so far, and I think enjoying what
        you do makes success more likely. I also have somewhat of a good eye for
        design and attention to detail. While both probably slow me down a bit,
        they usually lead to a good end result.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitations and Their Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Confidence is a work on for me. It’s also been a while since I last
        studied, so I’m still finding my feet with time management. Trying to
        find the balance between underdoing and overdoing tasks.
      </p>

      <h2>Working Through Tension</h2>
      <p>
        Once I was asked to prepare and give a presentation on the day, after
        hours, for a client who then didn’t show. I stayed quiet at the time and
        gave the presentation another day, but my team encouraged me to set
        firmer boundaries. If it happened again, I’d like to think I would be
        clearer about my expectations and what is and isn't acceptable in a
        business setting.
