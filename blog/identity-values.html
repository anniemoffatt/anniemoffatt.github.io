      <h2>Ethical Decision Making</h2>
      <p>
        I tend to prioritise stability, so after being made redundant the
        expected move was probably to look for another analyst type role. I
        realised the idea of that didn’t make me happy so I instead made the
        decision to study again, pursuing something I enjoy. It wasn’t the
        safest option, but felt like the right thing to do long term.
      </p>
      <h2>Cultural and Social Influences</h2>
      <p>
        I work best with structure, probably something I've picked up from my
        family. Kindness is also huge for me - I try to bring both into whatever
        I do.
      </p>
      <h2>Strengths in My Learning Journey</h2>
      <p>
        I've been enjoying development work so far and I think enjoying what you
        do makes success more likely. I also have somewhat of a good eye for
        design and attention to detail. While both probably slow me down a bit,
        they usually lead to an alright result.
      </p>
      <h2>Limitations and Their Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Confidence is a work on for me. It’s also been a while since I last
        studied so I’m still finding my feet in terms of time management. Trying
        to find the balance between underdoing and overdoing tasks.
      </p>
      <h2>Working Through Tension</h2>
      <p>
        Once I was asked to prepare and give a presentation on the day of (after
        hours too) for a client who then didn’t show. We pushed it an hour, they
        still didn't show. There was a lot involved in setting it all up so I
        was pretty annoyed, but didn't say anything at the time and just gave
        the presentation another day. My team later encouraged me to set firmer
        boundaries. If it happened again, I’d like to think I would be clearer
        about my expectations and what is and isn't acceptable (to me) in a work
        setting.
