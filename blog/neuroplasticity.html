      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

<h3>Understanding the Benefits</h3>

<p>The concept of neuroplasticity and the idea that our brains are pliable is really reassuring.</p>
<p>Knowing that we can change and adapt at any age brings comfort and a sense of hope/optimism - both of which are super important when it comes to learning new things and persevering through the hard parts.</p>

<h3>Ways to Increase Neuroplasticity</h3>

<p>The AGES method offers a useful framework for improving neuroplasticity:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">A</span>ttention - Minimise distractions to enhance focus</li>
<li><span class="highlight">G</span>eneration - Create meaningful connections by associating new information with prior knowledge</li>
<li><span class="highlight">E</span>motion - Engage with material emotionally to reinforce learning</li>
<li><span class="highlight">S</span>pacing - Space out learning to avoid overload and improve retention</li>
</ul>

<h3>Engaging</h3>

<p>I plan on incorporating the AGES method into my learning by practising the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">A</span>ttention - I live in a busy household with lots of distractions, I'm working on setting and sticking to regular non negotiable 'work' hours.</li>
<li><span class="highlight">G</span>eneration - I'm not sure I fully get this one - but I've found that by learning new things during the course I better understand previous work situations. The developers I used to work with might say things that at the time made no sense - but I've found myself thinking 'oh that's what they meant!'. This has also helped me visualise real life situations where course material might be used.</li>
<li><span class="highlight">E</span>motion - I really enjoy the rush you get when you finally understand something complicated - I'm trying to remind myself of that feeling when something feels overwhelming.</li>
<li><span class="highlight">S</span>pacing - I think the spacing is mostly done for us during Foundations. The curriculum is divided over weeks and doesn't dive too deep into any one subject at a time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A Useful Resource!</h3>

<p>The AGES method is discussed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88OL8NdkV-s">here.</a></p>

<h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

<h3>What Is It?</h3>
<p>A growth mindset is believing that ability and intelligence can develop over time through effort, perseverance and engagement. It's the opposite of a fixed mindset where people think their abilities are static/can't be changed significantly post childhood.</p>

<h3>What Surprised Me</h3>
<p>One resource talked about changing 'fail' grades (I'm assuming such as 'Not Achieved' or 'Failed') to 'Not Yet'. My last role was at a university and I worked on a project that followed the same concept - we changed certain grades to 'softer' ones. Admittedly at the time I didn't really see the point, they're all just variations of the same message. But I can see now, from the evidence, just how effective this shift can be.</p>

<h3>How I'll Use This</h3>
<p>The same resource mentioned someone who felt they had 'wasted' most of their life by having a fixed mindset - that's a pretty good deterrent in itself.</p>
<p>The video also talks about educators creating growth mindset classrooms - so I think the nature of the course itself helps here. By not 'scoring' us it takes away the need for validation which I've actually found really nice. Getting a bad grade can make you feel you're not capable/in the wrong place which I think could really throw someone off here.</p>
<p>The way I can integrate this into my own learning I think is to just trust the process, and focus on effort, perseverance and engagement.</p>

<h3>A Useful Resource!</h3>
<p>The resource I've been referring to can be found <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-459099">here.</a></p> </p>

<h2>Learning Plan</h2>

<h3>How These Relate to my Learning Plan</h3>
<p>Something I mentioned in my Learning Plan was that my confidence could be better. I think in particular that adopting a growth mindset could help with this - no bad grades to throw me off or dwell on.</p>
<p>The Learning Plan also talks about managing workloads - I think the AGES method will come in handy here.</p>
