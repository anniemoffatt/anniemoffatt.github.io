      <h2>What does it mean to Display Inline versus Inline Blocks?</h2>
      <p>
        Both are CSS terms that determine how an element behaves (layout wise).
        Originally I thought they only applied to images, but they can be used
        on any HTML element.
      </p>
      <h3>Display Inline</h3>
      <p>
        This means the element will sit in line with other elements. It doesn't
        start on a new line and you can't set the width or height.
      </p>
      <div>
      <p>Often used for:</p>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>Text level elements</li>
          <li>Keeping things in line with other content</li>
          <li>
            Styling small pieces of text without affecting layout (like changing
            the colour of just one word in a sentence)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      </div>
      <h3>Inline Blocks</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to Display Inline in the sense it still sits in line with other
        other elements, but with more flexibility. You can set the width,
        height, padding and margins.
      </p>
      <div>
      <p>Often used for:</p>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>Buttons you might want to size or space out</li>
          <li>Navigation links that need padding or custom styling</li>
          <li>Images you want to control the size of</li>
          <li>Form inputs like text fields or submit buttons</li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      </div>
      <div>
      <p>
        In short, both are ways to control how elements behave on a webpage.
        Inline is great for small elements that flow naturally with text, but
        you won't have much control over size. Block provides the side by side
        layout as well as the ability to to set width, height and spacing.
