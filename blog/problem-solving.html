    <h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>A time where I...</p>

<h3>Was blocked on a simple problem</h3>

<p>A question in the Manipulating Objects exercise was 'Add a children property to adam and assign it the value of terah.children'. I was super confident with the answer 'adam.children = terah.childrn'. It seemed obvious, I googled it and couldn't find anything suggesting otherwise but the test was still failing. Came back to it and realised it was just a typo. I should probably copy and paste when I'm given an exact value to replicate.</p>

<h3>Elegantly solved a problem</h2>

<p>I battled with my first table for a while. Despite looking it up something just wasn't clicking, I thought I had done everything the resource was telling me to do. It took saying it out loud (Rubber Ducky I guess) to realise I had listed all of the entries for one column within the same set of tags instead of the entries for one row. It was frustrating at the time but I'm pretty comfortable using them now, as you'll see below!</p>

<h2>Confidence</h2>

<table>
        <tr>
          <th>Method</th>
          <th>How Confident I Feel</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Pseudocode</td>
          <td>Medium - I understand the concept and how to do it, it just doesn't come naturally yet so I've often forgotten to use it</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Trying Something</td>
          <td>Strong - Most of this week was spent trying something, saving it then checking the test result</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Rubber Ducky</td>
          <td>Medium - Fully understand this idea but am yet to properly give it a go</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Reading Error Messages</td>
          <td>Medium - I used these quite a bit this week, sometimes the error messages themselves felt foreign too though</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Console.logging</td>
          <td>Medium - Getting more confident with this one, it's great when I remember to use it but again doesn't come naturally just yet</td>
        </tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>Googling</td>
	  <td>Strong - This was my instinct whenever I had issues. It comes naturally and feels the most productive</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>Asking Peers</td>
	  <td>Weak - Haven't really tried this yet - I guess I know how swamped I've been so haven't wanted to distract anyone else</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>Asking Coaches</td>
	  <td>Strong - they're super approachable and I really appreciated the group session we had last week. I guess I try the other methods first and if they don't work I would definitely ask a coach</td>
	</tr>
      </table>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>A time I was reluctant to ask for help was...</p>
<p>Last week I did most of the 'Tech' section before the 'Human Skills' section. When I got stuck with something in the Human Skills part (later in the week) I was wary of the fact it might have looked like I was only up to that part in the sprint. Got over that pretty quick though and asked anyway.</p>
