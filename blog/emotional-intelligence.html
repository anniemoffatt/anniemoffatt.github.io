      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>
        The ability to understand emotions - both yours and others. Here I'd say
        it's mostly about recognising when you might be feeling overwhelmed or
        frustrated and being able to take a moment and respond with intention. I
        think it's also about being aware of how those around you might be
        feeling and being sensitive to that.
      </p>
      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <p>
        IQ is a way of measuring how 'intelligent' someone is in a technical
        sense (book smart).
      </p>
      <p>
        EQ is a way of measuring how 'intelligent' someone is in an emotional
        sense (people smart).
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
      <p>
        I think EQ is the difference between doing well in this course and not.
        You could be super smart (book smart) and get through the content
        alright but without emotional intelligence, you might struggle with
        group work (a big part of the course) or with recognising and responding
        to your own or other people’s emotions.
